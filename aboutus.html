                <p>
                    The Federation of Payatas Youth Leaders is a dynamic group of youth parliamentarians who emerged from the
                    1st Payatas Youth Parliament, a three-day program spearheaded by the award-winning Sangguniang Kabataan
                    of Barangay Payatas that concluded on April 13, 2025.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the program, these young leaders exhibited a deep commitment to understanding parliamentary
                    procedures by actively attending sessions, applying legislative protocols, and crafting numerous proposed
                    resolutions and ordinances. Their engagement in reflective, respectful debates highlighted their readiness
                    to lead with purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, guided by the principles of ethical leadership and a shared dedication to youth empowerment, they are
                    taking their first steps in mobilizing as a force for positive change in their community.
